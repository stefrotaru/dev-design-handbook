## Overview

2. **[Alignment](./alignment)** — Order through structure
3. **[Repetition](./repetition)** — Consistency through patterns
4. **[Contrast](./contrast)** — Focus through differences
5. **[Balance](./balance)** — Weight distribution

## Why These Principles Matter

> "Every decision a developer makes affects the user experience of the website or application."

These principles help you:
- Create visual hierarchy
- Guide users' attention
- Reduce cognitive load
- Build trust through consistency
- Make content scannable and accessible

## Key Takeaway

- The layout is the most critical piece of a website’s design. It is quite literally the
foundation for the remaining pieces that will eventually be added to the website.
- Design is learnable — it's not about being "creative," it's about applying fundamental principles systematically.
