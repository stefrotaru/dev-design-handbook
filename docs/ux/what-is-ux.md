# What is User Experience (UX)?

**Core concept:** User experience refers to the totality of perceptions, emotions, and responses that result from a person's interaction with a product, system, or service.

## Beyond Usability

UX is about how a product works and how it makes the user feel while they are attempting to achieve a goal.

While a **user interface (UI)** focuses on what the user sees and interacts with, **UX** encompasses all parts of the system focused on the user, including the psychological and emotional states that occur during engagement.

## The Seven Facets of UX

Peter Morville defines these areas to ensure we deliver a meaningful experience:

- **Useful** — Does our site fulfill a need and do so successfully?
- **Usable** — Is the site easy to use?
- **Findable** — Is it easy to find things and navigate through the site?
- **Valuable** — Does the site bring value to those funding it? Does it create profit or fulfill a mission?
- **Desirable** — Is it well-designed? Does it use branding, imagery, and other elements to create a visually pleasing experience?
- **Credible** — Can users trust the content and its source?
- **Accessible** — Is the website accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technology to access the internet?


## Key Takeaway

These different facets provide a high-level overview of a project’s different areas. They
can be referenced throughout a project’s process to ensure that new features or content is aligned correctly.
