# UX Methodologies

**Core concept:** UX execution is structured into manageable, repeatable phases through established methodologies. The most common UX methodologies are User-Centred Design and the Double Diamond Process.

## User-Centred Design

This framework places the user at the core of every stage. It typically involves four phases:

- **Specify the context of use** — Identify who the primary target audience is, why they’re
using the product, what their requirements are, and under what circumstance
they’ll use it.
- **Specify requirements** — What business requirements or user goals need to be
achieved for the product to be successful?
- **Create design solutions** — The different phases of wireframing, visual mock-ups,
prototyping, and actual development happen here.
- **Evaluate designs** — Test your designs and prototypes, ideally with actual users, to
gather feedback and begin the iterative process of incorporating that feedback
into the designs.

## Double Diamond Process

This model uses **divergent thinking** (exploring a problem widely) and **convergent thinking** (taking focused action).

- **Discover** — Data is gathered through research to gain insight into the problem.
- **Define** — Research is filtered through to focus on and define the problem to
solve.
- **Develop** — Multiple solutions are explored and tested.
- **Deliver** — Solutions are honed down to the most successful one, which is then
delivered. 



## Choosing a Methodology

| Methodology | Best For | Key Strength |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| User-Centred Design | Products with clear user needs | Continuous user involvement |
| Double Diamond | Complex problems needing exploration | Balanced divergent/convergent thinking |

## Key Takeaway

Both methodologies share a common thread: they are iterative and user-focused. The key is to choose a framework that fits your project and team, then adapt it as needed while keeping the user at the center of every decision.
